# Mini Physics Engine with Buoyancy

Sample C# project for an internal Unity lecture in 2018, aimed at junior/future engineers.

This is a super-simple C# "game" + "physics engine" that Mantas Puida made to show how one might do simple 2D physics engine from scratch.

My goal is to add Bouyancy force to extend capabilities of this simple "physics engine".

Update: goal has been reached successfully, buoyancy is up and running.

To calculate partial area of a circle that's under water (I used area instead of a circle since this is a 2D project) I've used this:
