# Mini Physics Engine with Buoyancy

Sample C# project for an internal Unity lecture in 2018, aimed at junior/future engineers.

This is a super-simple C# "game" + "physics engine" _(just a bunch of sprites moving around with very small amount of logic really)_. Mantas Puida made to show how one might do simple 2D physics engine from scratch.

My goal is to add Bouyancy force to extend capabilities of this simple "physics engine"
